******************************COVID-19 Status Tracker******************************
With the current pandemic that we are experiencing, I find it inconvenient to get the latest case updates regarding COVID-19 globally and locally. So I have decided to create a simple web app that gives us the core information in a glance without having to lurk the internet that works in web browsers. The data used in the app are based on the main sources of information regarding COVID cases.

I thought I'd share the web app with you and hopefully you would find it helpful as well. Feel free to share it with your family and friends to keep everyone informed with the latest update on Corana virus.
